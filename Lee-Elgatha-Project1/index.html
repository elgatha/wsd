            <h1><a id="about">About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi, my name is <strong>Apple-Elgatha</strong> and I'm from Nassau originally which is in the Bahamas. At 26 years old I left Nassau, to pursue my culinary career and never looked back.Recently, I've been going back and forth to Nassau, which for a normal person would be loads of fun, but for me it is more of a duty. I can't use work as an excuse any longer to not go home to visit. Last years I took  a vacation for two weeks. Which is the longest time I've been on the island in 12 years. I don't know if I'll be able to cope, plus when you're used to going non-stop, when you finally do, it's hard to know what to do, and my family gives me the worst anxiety, ever!</p>
            <p>The first person I always visit when I return to Nassau is my grandmother, she whispers in to my ear this time &quot;Don't let them drive you bat-shit crazy!&quot;</p>
            <h4>Being Me:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Take Xanax* being on an island, that is 7 miles by 21 miles for two weeks can drive anyone nuts</li>
                <li>Make sure that there is a lot of alcohol available - I'm not really a drinker, so I'll be passed out for the majority of the trip or at least buzzed</li>
                <li>Take as many obnoxious selfies as humanly possible</li>
                <li>Keep and Open Mind and Heart</li>
                <li>Use this time to heal</li>
            </ul>    
            <p><strong>*NOTE: Taking Xanax before the plane taxi's from the terminal is not a good idea. the result will be drool on oneself which in itself is ridiculously embarrassing. </strong></p>
            <p id="nassau">It is easy to wish for the comforts of the US, <strong>especially when you're sitting in a dark house in 90 degree weather and the bloody electric company is power sharing at 4 in the morning.</strong> For as much as The Bahamas is my home, my country, my birth-right, living here drives me NUTS.</p>
            <h4>That's Why They Call It Al-Co-Hol:</h4>
            <ul id="alcohol">
                <li>Kalik Beer (The National Beer of the Bahamas)</li>
                <li>Sky Juice (some Gin, Coconut Water and Condensed Milk drink that'll make you black-out)</li>
                <li>Vodka and Tonic (the go to when you're sitting and having a conversation with the Prime Minister of the Bahamas who stops by your Dad's House because he heard you were in town)</li>
                <li>My Brother's Kool-Aid concoction I like to call Donky Kong (because it kicks you in the teeth and the head)</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>The Must-Have Things to Eat:</h4>
            <ul id="food">
                <li>Conch Salad from Blue Wave on Potter's Cay Dock</li>
                <li>Cracked Conch, Peas &amp; Rice with Cole Slaw</li>
                <li>My Gran's Homemade Guava Jam on Warm Raisin Bread</li>
                <li>Stewed Conch</li>
                <li>Boiled Fish with Johnny Cake</li>
                <li>Fried Red Snapper</li>
                <li>Tuna Fish Salad and Yellow Grits</li>
                <li>Sardines Salad</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>The Moral Of This Story</h3>
            <p id="moral">Don't take Xanax before you fly and most certainly don't take it with alcohol, travel with enough money that if the country you are in can't get it together and stop load sharing electricity you can stay in quaint little places that have generators, drink as much alcohol as possible, eat as much food as possible, and when the Prime Minister says that he has never been more proud of a single Bahamian -- try for the love of sweet baby Jesus not to snort Vodka and Tonic through your nostrils... and remember that life is too short to care what anyone thinks HAVE FUN!!!!</p>
