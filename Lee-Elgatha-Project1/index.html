            <h1><a id="about">About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi, my name is <strong>Apple-Elgatha</strong> and I'm from Nassau originally which is in the Bahamas. At 26 years old I left Nassau, to pursue my culinary career and never looked back until this Christmas Holiday 12 years later. For the first time in 12 years, I'm taking a vacation for two weeks. This is the longest time I will be still. I don't know if I'll be able to cope, when you're used to going non-stop, when you finally do, it's hard to know what to do, plus my family gives me the worst anxiety, ever!</p>
            <p>My Grandmother whispers to me the first time she sees me</p>
            <h4>Requirements For Going Home and Surviving:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Take Xanax* for the 2 weeks that you will be on island, that is 7 miles by 21 miles</li>
                <li>Make sure that there is a lot of alcohol available</li>
                <li>Spend as little time in one place as possible</li>
                <li>Take as many obnoxious selfies as humanly possible</li>
                <li>Open Mind</li>
                <li>Open Heart</li>
            </ul>    
            <p><strong>*NOTE: Taking Xanax before the plane taxi's from the terminal is not a good idea. the result will be drool on oneself. </strong></p>
            <p id="nassau">It is relatively easy to get lost in the memories of why I left home and didn't return for 12 years, but <strong>then I remember why I left when I'm sitting in a dark house in 90 degree weather and the bloody electric company is power sharing at 4 in the morning.</strong> For as much as The Bahamas is my home, my country, my birth-right, living here drives me absolutely bat-shit crazy.</p>
            <h3>Sober Activities:</h3>
            <p id="sober">While at home for my visit. I attempted to be sober for the experience <strong>NOTE: LET ME TELL YOU HOW BAD OF AN IDEA THAT WAS. AFTER TWO DAYS, THE ONLY THING LEFT TO DO WAS DRINK.</strong> Unfortunately my version of Cheers closed it's doors permamnently a week after I arrived so I was left to drink by myself.</p>
            <h4>The Best Beverages in Nassau</h4>
            <ul id="alcohol">
                <li>Kalik Beer -- The National Beer of the Bahamas</li>
                <li>Vodka and Tonic</li>
                <li>My Brother's Kool-Aid concoction I like to call Donky Kong</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>The Must-Have Things to Eat:</h4>
            <ul id="food">
                <li>Conch Salad from Blue Wave on Potter's Cay Dock</li>
                <li>Cracked Conch, Peas &amp; Rice with Cole Slaw</li>
                <li>My Gran's Homemade Guava Jam on Warm Raisin Bread</li>
                <li>Stewed Conch</li>
                <li>Boiled Fish with Johnny Cake</li>
                <li>Fried Red Snapper</li>
                <li>Tuna Fish Salad and Yellow Grits</li>
                <li>Sardines Salad</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Where I Lived</h3>
            <p>After BEC kept load sharing the lights I decided to check into a bed and breakfast called <a href ="http://www.graycliff.com"> Graycliff</a>, It's owned by the Gazarolis, the food is phenomenal, and I smoked cigars to my heart's content in their Cigar Factory. After a few days there I ventured on over to  <a href="http://www.compasspointbeachresort.com/">Island Outpost's Compass Point</a> this is where I stayed for the rest of my trip and it was actually heaven.</p>
            <h3>The Moral Of This Story</h3>
            <p id="moral">Don't take Xanax before you fly and most certainly don't take it with alcohol, travel with enough money that if the country you are in can't get it together and stop load sharing electricity you can stay in quaint little places that have generators, drink as much alcohol as possible, ea as much food as possible and remember that life is too short to care what anyone thinks. HAVE FUN!!!!</p>
