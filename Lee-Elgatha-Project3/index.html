                <p id="about">Hi, my name is <strong>Apple-Elgatha</strong> and I'm from Nassau originally which is in the Bahamas. At 26 years old I left Nassau, to pursue my culinary career and never looked back.Recently, I've been going back and forth to Nassau, which for a normal person would be loads of fun, but for me it is more of a duty. I can't use work as an excuse any longer to not go home to visit. Last years I took  a vacation for two weeks. Which is the longest time I've been on the island in 12 years. I don't know if I'll be able to cope, plus when you're used to going non-stop, when you finally do, it's hard to know what to do, and my family gives me the worst anxiety, ever!</p>
            <p>The first person I always visit when I return to Nassau is my grandmother, she whispers in to my ear this time --</p><blockquote>&quot;Don't let them drive you bat-shit crazy!&quot;</blockquote>
                <h4>Being Me</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Take Xanax* for the 2 weeks that I'll be on an island, that is 7 miles by 21 miles</li>
                    <li>Make sure that there is a lot of alcohol available</li>
                    <li>Spend as little time in one place as possible</li>
                    <li>Take as many obnoxious selfies as humanly possible</li>
                    <li>Open Mind</li>
                    <li>Open Heart</li>
                </ul>
                    <p><b>*NOTE: Taking Xanax before the plane taxi's from the terminal is not a good idea. the result will be drool on oneself.</b></p>
                    <p id="nassau">It is relatively easy to get lost in the memories of why I left home and didn't return for 12 years, but .<strong>then I remember why I left when I'm sitting in a dark house in 90 degree weather and the bloody electric company is power sharing at 4 in the morning.</strong> For as much as The Bahamas is my home, my country, my birth-right, living here drives me absolutely bat-shit crazy.</p>
                <p>That is easier said than done, <strong>especially when you're sitting in a dark house in 90 degree weather and the bloody electric company is power sharing at 4 in the morning, trying to have a conversation with people you don't normally have conversations with.</strong> For as much as The Bahamas is my home, my country, my birth-right, living here would drive me bat-shit-crazy</p>
            <h4>That's Why They Call It Al-Co-Hol:</h4>
                <ul id="alcohol">
                    <li>Kalik Beer -- The National Beer of the Bahamas</li>
                    <li>Vodka and Tonic</li>
                    <li>My Brother's Kool-Aid concoction I like to call <abbr title="Donky Kong">D'Kong</abbr> (because it kicks you in the teeth and the head)</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>The Must-Have Things to Eat:</h4>
                <ul id="eating">
                    <li>Conch Salad from Blue Wave on Potter's Cay Dock</li>
                    <li>Cracked Conch, Peas & Rice with Cole Slaw</li>
                    <li>My Gran's Homemade Guava Jam on Warm Raisin Bread</li>
                    <li>Stewed Conch</li>
                    <li>Boiled Fish with Johnny Cake</li>
                    <li>Fried Red Snapper</li>
                    <li>Tuna Fish Salad and Yellow Grits</li>
                    <li>Sardines Salad</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>The Moral Of This Story Is</h3>
                <p id="moral">Don't take Xanax before you fly and most certainly don't take it with alcohol, travel with enough money that if the country you are in can't get it together and stop load sharing electricity you can stay in quaint little places that have generators, drink as much alcohol as possible, eat as much food as possible, and when the Prime Minister says that he has never been more proud of a single Bahamian -- try for the love of sweet baby Jesus not to snort Vodka and Tonic through your nostrils... and remember that life is too short to care what anyone thinks HAVE FUN!!!!</p>
